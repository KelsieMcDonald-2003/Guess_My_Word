# Guess_My_Word
 
Guess My Word is a game that combines Wheel of Fortune and Wordle. A user can choose between easy, normal, and hard mode.

## Modes
Easy mode grants a user seven tries. If a user incorrectly guesses a word, it will display the category, number of tries left, and a message letting the user know they are incorrect.

Normal and hard mode are similar to easy mode, but has less tries. Normal mode grants 5 tries and hard mode only grants three.
